Organizing your assets
This is where the fun begins! Before we start coding, we need three additional assets:

1-The postcard background — download this image and save it in the same directory as your working HTML file.
2-A typewriter font: The "Mom's Typewriter" font from dafont.com — download the TTF file into the same directory as above.
3-A hand drawn font: The "Journal" font from dafont.com — download the TTF file into the same directory as above.
